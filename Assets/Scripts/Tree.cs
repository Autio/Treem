    /*
     * A tree clicker game
     * 
     * Two levels of play: Individual tree level and the forest level
     * Players can control three parts of the tree in two dimensions each
     * Roots can be either extended or convoluted
     * The branches can be extended or convoluted
     * The trunk can be long and thin or shorter and thicker
     * 
     * The growing environment impacts which kind of trees thrive best
     * 
     * The pace of the game is casual and gentle
     * 
     * Visually there should be buttons on the sides of the mobile screen 
     * A box of key stats on the top
     * 
     * It would be great if the tree itself was a voxel one, procedurally generated based on the choices 
     * 
     * 
     * At the higher forest level there should be delineated circle domains each with their own characteristics
     * which are combination of three factors (?) perhaps wetness, sunshine and soil quality
     *
